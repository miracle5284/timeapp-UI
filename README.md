# ðŸ•’ Chrona Frontend

Chrona is a modern, high-precision countdown timer application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**. Designed for reliability and seamless UX, it empowers users to start, pause, reset, and persist countdowns across browser sessions, even after refreshes or device sleep.

Chrona integrates tightly with backend APIs and optionally leverages the **Timer Keeper** Chrome extension for enhanced background performance on modern browsers.
